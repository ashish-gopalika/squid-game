If you win you, can you get a prize but if you lose the other person can slap you. You have lost the first few games. Now with a face red with slap marks, mind infuriated with vengeance determined to win you try again and win.
You wanted to slap the person but he stopped you and gave you a prize instead as per the agreement. He also extended the offer that if you want to win more you can contact us handing out a card as shown below.
